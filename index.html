          Recently Iâ€™ve been thinking about celebrating, and celebrations in
          general. I was raised to love celebrations. Growing up, my mother
          would take my sister and I to our great grandmothers home in the
          middle of nowhere Georgia. My family would have cookouts what seemed
          like every week. Everyone in my family would be eating and drinking
          and laughing together. Every holiday was celebrated. Every birthday,
          every graduation. Even without an excuse or a justification there was
          always bound to be some sort of celebration. The times that I have
          come to live in have made the idea of celebration seem to me,
          unjustifiable. The overwhelming feeling of apocalyptic doom settles
          upon us all everyday. I currently feel like there are ways in which
          the world has already ended. The more troubling portion of that
          realization is that those failed parts of the world must have come to
          an end before I was born.
